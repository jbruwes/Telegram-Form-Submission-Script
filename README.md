# Cloudflare based Telegram Form Submission

This is a simple Cloudflare worker script that can submitt html form data with help of Cloudflare worker and Telegram bot api.

## What You need to get started:

To run this project, you will need a Cloudflare account and have to add the following environment variables to your Cloudflare workers settings.

`TELEGRAM_API_KEY` = "You get it from @Botfather"

`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` = "Your telegram Group id you get using @MissRose_bot"

`ALLOWED_ORIGIN` = "Your website url"

## Setting up Telegram

### Step 1:
Open Botfather and create a new bot and you will get an API key keep it safe to use later

### Step 2:
Create a Group and add your newly created bot in the Group and give admin permission to it.(Its important to give admin permission to receive messages)

### Step 3:
You have to figure out your Group id, it can be done by adding another popular bot in your Group which is MissRose_bot ` https://t.me/MissRose_bot`
Give it admin permission and send `/id` in the group. You will get your group id which looks something like this `-10069696969669`

#### Ya, everything is done here for Telegram part

## HTML form Use case 
Html use case is farely simple just replace the `POST` `action` url to cloudflare workers url
#### Make sure for="" and id="" values are similar
I have given the minimum code for demonstration purposes please feel free  to use your creativity.

Here is the code you need to replace the `https://yourcloudflare.workers.dev/` to your workers url.
```
<form id="contactForm" action="https://yourcloudflare.workers.dev/" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
        <br>
   		<label for="Phone">Phone No:</label>
        <input type="number" id="Phone" name="Phone" required>
   <br/>
        <label for="subject">Subject:</label>
        <input type="text" id="subject" name="Subject" required>
        <br>
      <!--   <label for="options">Options:</label>
        <select id="options" name="options" required>
            <option value="" disabled selected>Select an option</option>
